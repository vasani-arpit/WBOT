for linux you need to provide exacutable permission before you exacute the binary do
```
chmod +x wbot-linux && wbot-linux
```

*I haven't tested Mac and Linix binaries. If you find any issues using them feel free to raise one from [here](https://github.com/vasani-arpit/WBOT/issues/new)*

### Configurations 

Basic Configuration is in bot.json file like replying to Hi, hello and happy birthday. you can add/remove yours if you need. keep in mind that you need to restart the wbot to see the effect of change. make sure json is valid. use VSCode or [jsonlint](https://jsonlint.com/) to validate json.

### bot.json 

**appconfig**

This is where all the application related(node application behavior and such things) config will stay. will add more in future.

- **headless** Whether to start chrome as headless or not. this is regarding #4. Apparently, Whatsapp doesn't allow headless instances.
- **isGroupReply** Whether to send replies in group or not. If set to false Bot will not reply if message received in group chat.

**bot**

An array of objects. Properties of Object are self explanatory. 

- **Contains** If message has one of that word anywhere in the message
- **exact** If message is exactly as one of the messages form array

- **Response** If any of the above conditions becomes true then corresponding response string will be sent as message to the user or group.

- **file** name of the file (from current directory) which you want to send along with response 

**Blocked**

Array of numbers with county code to which this bot will not reply to.

**noMatch**

Default reply message when no exact match found in BOT

An object which contains suggestions and it's configs.

## 💻 Technologies
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer)


## Why?

The main reason I decided to build this is that I need a simple tool to reply to my "happy birthday" message. I know it is kind of blunt and rude but it would take me 2-3 days to reply to all and by that time that moment would be gone. I just need a good solution to this problem. I really don't need a full-fledged AI-BOT or BOT with NLU (or some other acronym). I believe there are many people who also have such need.

## Goals
With that in mind, I know that WBOT would need to satisfy these criteria:

* 🚀 Fast!!!
* 👍 Friendly CLI UX
* 🔒 Does not touch user’s data
* 💰 Free! for personal use

If you think WBOT delivers these, let me know by putting a star ⭐ on this project

  I do motion design and UI/UX development.
